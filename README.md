# gameboy-game
some open-sourced games I am developing for the gameboy 
programmed with C/C++ and gameboy development kit 2020
gbdk is a newer tool that lets you write gameboy games in C and compiles them to Assembly


--edit 
honestly this was some of the hardest game development i was faced with
working with 8bit computers and fantasy consoles has taught me a lot
